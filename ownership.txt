1. Each value in Rust has an owner
2. There can only be one owner at a time
3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped

Note: the ownner of a value is the variable or a data structure that holds it and is responsible for allocating and freeing the memory used to store the data.

scope
scope is a range within a program for which an item is valid

Global scope
accesible throughout the entire program

local scope
accesible only within particular function or a block of code
not accesible outside of function or block

scope eg:
{   let h="hello"; } Here h is the owner only within the scope i.e the closed curly brackets

other datatypes are stored in stacks since known sizes, strings are stored in heaps since dynamic size
